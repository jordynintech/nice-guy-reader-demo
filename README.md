# 📘 Nice Guy Reader — Demo

This is a self-guided, offline-friendly reading experience for *No More Mr. Nice Guy* by Dr. Robert Glover.  
It includes audio narration, chapter text, and reflection questions — all thoughtfully crafted to help you move chapter by chapter.

> 💬 **Note:** I created this for a close friend — to make their reading experience more personal, supportive, and easy to follow.  
I recorded the audio in my own voice and designed everything to feel calm, clear, and private.
